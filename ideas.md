### There are many things left to make in this world. I like to think about new concepts for making life easier and more rewarding. Here is a running list of ideas. If you have made things like this, or plan to get in touch:

# Products

1. ### System to make pitch decks and investor updates based on live data. 
    - PDFs and slides only convey low-fidelity, outdated information.
    - Ideally based on git repos, python/js notebooks, retool, etc
2. ### Continuously updated playbooks to help founders and investors characterize startup risks, split by vertical.
    - Design, data structures, app frameworks, payments, legal, social, content management
    - Increase early focus on what matters
    - Increase founder/investor alignment on expected outcomes
3.  ### Systems to generate large-scale general intelligence datasets
4.  ### Tools to help founders calculate the ‘correct’ amount of capital they should rasie relative to exit potential and timeframe
5.  ### fMRI brain image reconstruction.
    - Train multi-modal AI to 'hallucinate' images from brain data []()
    - Work to advance legal issues this will create
6. ### System or network founders can use to signal 'I am working on X <idea, thing, tool, etc>'. 
    - Facilitate collaboration vs. competition on hard problems. Reduce # of avoidable failures
    - Twitter sort of fills this role. Could be more direct. 
7. ### Generative AI to produce infographics or rich python notebooks from general data/text/websites.
8. ### Systems to understand the inner workings of a public company before investing
    - Show inflows vs. outflows (product, ROIC)
    - Show growth assumptions based on current pricing
    - *I am working on this at Invest Like the Rest, but the scope is too large*
9. ### Create detailed language to describe thought, internal monologue, visualization
    - *I am working on this currently*
10. ### Highly generalized system to parse situational context from abiguous environments (online, in-person)
    - Enables metadata enrichment for open world problems. 
11. ### Natural language APIs
    - Use situational context to build and execute syntactically correct API calls on-the-fly
    - Enable bidding market to fulfill commands
12. ### Marketplace for startups to share marketing exposure or sponsorships
13. ### Strongly curated Product Hunt alternative with focus on product development and feedback
    - Place for harsh critical feedback (could be a stand-alone idea)
    - Interview style where founder narrative has prominence (likely templated)
    - Exhaust data offered for sale
    - Higher signal to noise
    - Direct conncetions to Angels and early stage capital
14. ### YC for 'tenthicorns'. Align incentives for creating many $50-$100m liquidity events without the failure rate of seeking home runs
    - Have batches that share equity amongst each other
    - Optimize for profitability *and* growth (in that order)
    - Optimize for exits in ~5yrs vs 10-12yrs for VC
15. ### Easy / universal way to accept critical feedback on products and websites

# Concepts

1. #### I strongly support any new system that removes hidden assumptions people make
2. #### New styles of education and gap years that let young people try many different lifestyles
3. #### New systems to assess and reset drug tolerance/dependance
4. #### Next generation stimulants, euphorics, and neuroprotectives
5. #### Methods to produce detailed mapping of autobiographical, spatial, and emotional memory
6. #### Anything that lets users become stakeholders (not affiliates) in products/places/etc they use
