## There are many things left to make in this world. I like to think about new concepts for making life easier and more rewarding. Here is a running list of ideas. If you have made things like this, or plan to get in touch: [Email me](mailto:tyler@lastovich.me) or [DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tylerlastovich)

# Products

1. ### System to make pitch decks and investor updates based on git repos + python notebooks
    - PDFs and slides only convey low-fidelity, outdated information.   
2. ### Shared, continuously playbooks that stand-up niche startups.
    - Design, data structures, app frameworks, payments, legal, social, content management
    - Increase early focus on what matters
3.  ### Systems to generate large-scale general intelligence datasets
4.  ### Tools to help founders raise the ‘correct’ amount of capital relative to exit potentials
5.  ### fMRI brain image reconstruction.
    - Train multi-modal AI to 'hallucinate' images from brain data []()
    - Work to advance legal issues this will create
6. ### System or network founders can use to signal 'I am working on X <idea, thing, tool, etc>'. 
    - Facilitate collaboration vs. competition on hard problems. Reduce # of avoidable failures
7. ### AI to produce infographics or rich python notebook from general text/websites.
8. ### Systems to understand the inner workings of a public company before investing
    - Show inflows vs. outflows (product, ROIC)
    - Show growth assumptions based on current pricing
    - *I am working on this at Invest Like the Rest, but the scope is too large*
9. ### Create detailed language to describe thought, internal monologue, visualization
    - *I am working on this for Paths Bio*
10. ### System to parse situational context from abiguous environments
    - Enables metadata enrichment for open world problems. 
11. ### Natural language APIs
    - Use situational context to build and execute syntactically correct API calls on-the-fly
    - Enable bidding market to fulfill commands
12. ### Marketplace for startups to share marketing exposure or sponsorships
13. ### Strongly curated Product Hunt with focus on product development and feedback
    - Place for harsh critical feedback (could be a stand-alone idea)
    - Higher signal to noise


# Concepts

1. #### I strongly support any new system that removes hidden assumptions people make
2. #### New systems to assess and reset drug tolerance/dependance
3. #### Next generation stimulants and euphorics
4. #### Methods to produce detailed mapping of autobiographical, spatial, and emotional memory
5. #### Anything that lets customers become stakeholders (not affiliates) in products they use/promote
